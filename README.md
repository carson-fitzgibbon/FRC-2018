# FRC-2018

This is the 2018 code for Team 4206's robot, which currently plans to use West Coast Drive with four six inch Coleson wheels on either side with an eighth inch drop center on the middle two, with the rearmost pair driven by two CIMs each and connected with belts to the next three pairs.
